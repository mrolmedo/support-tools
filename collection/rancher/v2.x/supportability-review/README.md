## How to use

1. Download the `collect.sh` script on a Linux node and make it executable.

    Using wget
    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/supportability-review/collect.sh
    chmod +x collect.sh
    ```
   Using curl
   ```shell
    curl -OLs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/supportability-review/collect.sh
    chmod +x collect.sh
    ```
2. Set the required environment variables.
    ```shell
   export RANCHER_URL="https://rancher.example.com"
   export RANCHER_TOKEN="token-a1b2c:hp7nxfs25w5g7rlc6gkasddhzpphfjbgmcqg6g2kpv52gxg7tl2fgpq2q"
 
   ```
3. Run the collection script
The script needs to be run directly on the node, using the root user or a user in the docker group. Ensure the docker daemon is running.
```
 ./collect.sh
```
4. Share the generated support bundle with SUSE Rancher Support Team.
Output will be written  as a tar.gz archive in the same path where the script is run.
