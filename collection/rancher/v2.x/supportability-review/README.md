# Supportability Review

Ensure business continuity with ongoing reviews and advice. Get faster resolutions, prevent incidents, minimize drift whilst staying conformant with our validated configurations.

## Notes
This script is intended to collect info from Rancher upstream cluster and RKE1 managed downstream clusters [CF Additional use]

### What's being collected?

Please review the below files for details:

- [cluster-collector.sh](./cluster-collector.sh)
- [nodes-collector.sh](./nodes-collector.sh) ## Runs on every node of the cluster.

## Pre-requisites


- [ ] **Node requirements**
  - Connectivity: 
      - Access to Rancher URL
                
      - Access to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ to download the collect.sh script
      
      - Access to ghcr.io/rancherlabs repository to download the docker image used in the collect.sh script.
                
  - Packages:  
      - Docker installed
       
      - wget or curl tool
   
- [ ] **Permissions** 
      - ‚ö†Ô∏è ü•¶ üí• Generate Rancher Bearer Token.  [How to generate a token](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/user-settings/api-keys#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback).
      
     :no_mouth: A truism is that the user that generates the token will collect only clusters allowed to. The user has to be owner, as member it will fail[^1]
      
## How to use

1. **Download the `collect.sh` script on a Linux node and make it executable**

    Using wget
    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/supportability-review/collect.sh
    chmod +x collect.sh
    ```
   Using curl
   ```shell
    curl -OLs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/supportability-review/collect.sh
    chmod +x collect.sh
    ```
2. **Set the required environment variables**
    ```shell
   export RANCHER_URL="https://rancher.example.com"
   export RANCHER_TOKEN="token-a1b2c:hp7nxfs25w5g7rlc6gkasddhzpphfjbgmcqg6g2kpv52gxg7tl2fgpq2q"
 
   ```
3. **Run the collection script**

 The script needs to be run directly on the node, using the root user or a user in the ```docker group```. Ensure the docker daemon is running.
  - 3.1 Collect all clusters
```
 ./collect.sh
```
 - 3.2 Collect selected clusters
 ```
 ./collect.sh --cluster c-m-lqh85wln  --cluster local
```
 
4. **Share the generated support bundle with SUSE Rancher Support Team.**

Output will be written as a tar.gz archive in the same path where the script is run.

## Flags
```shell
Rancher Supportability Review
Usage: collect.sh [ --cluster  <cluster-name> --cluster <cluster-id>]

All flags are optional.
```
## FAQ
1) Racher DS cluster are X but the scann does not detect all
```
INFO     | sscan |__main__:collect_info_from_clusters_using_rancher_api:288 - No of clusters detected: 2
```
The user (Bearer Token) does not have access to that cluster.

2) Access forbidden
```
ERRO[0000] Preflight checks failed
ERRO[0000] could not retrieve list of pods: pods is forbidden: User "u-mrhdf" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "kube-system"
```
The user (Bearer Token) has access but not full permission. ## Member vs Owner
